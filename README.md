# The Story/Media Ontology

The purpose of this ontology is to store information about works of art and media and their connections, approaching the issue from two points of view:

1. the continuous flow of plot throughout multiple works based on fictional storytelling (which works tell related stories, in which order they should be experienced...) - the primary approach

2. grouping of multiple works into greater wholes based on production or marketing, such as series and brands

For concrete information about the entities in the ontology, check the OWL doc documentation (data about individuals seems to be incorrectly exported by Protégé, showing nonexisting assertions in the OWL doc for most individuals).

## Authors:

- Jakub Kloc - Universe and Work classes and Work subclasses; most object properties; individuals demonstrating various Work types and their relationships in some media (Tolkien's works, Lion King, Avatar the Last Airbender, Spider-man)
- Matúš Ratkovský - data properties; classes Person, Genre and Company, their subclasses, and all related object properties; individuals demonstrating the aforementioned classes; labelling of existing individuals with data properties
