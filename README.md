# MediaOntology

The purpose of this ontology is to store information about works of art and media and their connections, approaching the issue from two points of view:

1. the continuous flow of plot throughout multiple works based on fictional storytelling (which works tell related stories, in which order they should be experienced...) - the primary approach

2. grouping of multiple works into greater wholes based on production or marketing, such as series and brands

For concrete information about the entities in the ontology, check the OWL doc documentation.
